[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FabriceGhislain7/data_analyst_scientist/blob/main/titanic_project_python/main.ipynb)

This repository presents a detailed **Data Analysis project** focused on the Titanic dataset. The project utilizes **Python** for advanced analysis and **Excel** for supplementary data exploration.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Analyze passenger survival rates by examining factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and family size.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Excel.
- **Files Included**:
  - `main.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data exploration, cleaning, and visualization process.
  - `data_titanic.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Getting Started
1. Open the `main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, and generate visualizations.
3. Modify or extend the analysis as needed.

## Future Enhancements
This project is part of an ongoing effort to explore and analyze diverse datasets. More data-driven projects will be added in the future.
