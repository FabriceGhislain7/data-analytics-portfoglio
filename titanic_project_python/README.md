## **Dataset Information**  

- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv)  
- **Files Used**:  
  - `train.csv`: Training dataset with labeled survival information.  
  - `test.csv`: Unlabeled dataset used for making predictions.  
- **Dataset Content**:  
  - Passenger Information: Age, gender, class, fare, number of family members.  
  - Survival Status: 1 (Survived), 0 (Did not survive).

## **Upcoming Enhancements**  

The next update will introduce advanced data manipulation techniques, including:  
- **`merge()`**: Combine datasets based on common keys (e.g., passenger ID).  
- **`join()`**: Merge dataframes based on index values.  
- **`concat()`**: Stack datasets vertically or horizontally for enriched feature engineering.  

These techniques will enhance dataset preparation and improve predictive modeling capabilities.
