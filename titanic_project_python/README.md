**üìå Upcoming Enhancements: Data Merging and Joining Techniques**  

The next update will include advanced data manipulation techniques such as `join`, `merge`, and `concat` to further enhance the dataset and improve feature engineering. These operations will allow us to efficiently combine multiple datasets, handle missing information, and create enriched variables for predictive modeling.  

Planned operations:  
- `merge()`: Combining datasets based on common keys (e.g., passenger ID). Useful for integrating additional datasets such as complementary passenger records.  
- `join()`: Merging dataframes based on index values, useful for aligning datasets with similar structures.  
- `concat()`: Stacking datasets either vertically (row-wise) or horizontally (column-wise) for appending new features or aggregating different subsets of data.  

These data merging operations will be crucial for preparing a more comprehensive dataset for machine learning models.
