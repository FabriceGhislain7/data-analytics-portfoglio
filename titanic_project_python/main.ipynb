        "\n",
        "After analyzing and handling outliers in the \"Age\" variable using two different approaches, we observed the following:  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Eliminating Outliers Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) Method.\n",
        "   - This method completely removed all outlier values** that fell outside the calculated IQR boundaries.\n",
        "   - While this ensures that extreme values do not distort the analysis, it also results in data loss by reducing the number of observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Replacing Outliers with the Mean.  \n",
        "   - Instead of removing outliers, this method replaced them with the mean of non-outlier values.\n",
        "   - This approach preserved all observations, ensuring no data loss.\n",
        "   - However, some of the extreme values were still present in the dataset but were transformed to a less extreme value.\n",
        "\n",
        " Key Takeaways  \n",
        "- The IQR method is effective in completely eliminating outliers, which is useful when outliers represent errors or extreme anomalies.  \n",
        "- Replacing outliers with the mean retains all data points, which can be beneficial when dealing with small datasets or when outliers hold some meaningful information.  \n",
        "- The choice of method depends on the objective**:  \n",
        "  - If preserving all data is crucial → Use replacement methods (mean, median, etc.).  \n",
        "  - If ensuring a clean dataset without extreme influence is a priority → Use elimination methods (IQR, Z-score, etc.).  \n"
